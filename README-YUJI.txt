Hello! This is Guilherme Yuji Endo

This web-app is a website that is being made for a Indie Musician Friend, the band is called sioxi.

Laravel-PHP is the main framework, and we use a lot of JS for front-end, we also use Bootstrap for the CSS (With custom ones) and of course HTML.

Just FYI: I decided to not separed CSS and JS scripts into another file because the project is not big per se, but i'm very aware that is bad practice.

And the migrations are kinda outdated, i included a sql file for dummy testing.
